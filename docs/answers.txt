(a) $ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        docs/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

(b) 8
git log

(c) Wed Sep 25 18:13:30 2019 -0400
git log

(d) branches are used to create new pointers to commits and allows you to navigate through commits

(e) git log shows the entire history of commits and get status shows what is going to be commited

(f) git log --follow Vehicle.h 

(g) git log --grep "file" 

(h) Inheritance: Using a parent class to provide the same implentation to another sub class.
	Polymorphism: When classes are related by inheritance, a call to a member function 
		will cause a different function to be executed depending on the object that calls the function.
	Encapsulation: Using set and get functions to manipulate private date.

(i) The main difference between the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow and the “Integration manager” workflow
	is in the Integration Manager workflow developers have ther own private repositories that they can push to public repositories
	and in Dictator and Lieutenants workflow private repositories must be pushed to higher ups before being sent to a public repository.

(j) A team of 100 developers benefit from following the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow instead of the “Centralized” workflow because Dictators and Lieutenants
	help orgainze the data that the private developers are working on and keeping the project uniform.


5. This assignment uses both encapsulation and polymorphism. Encapsulation because there are multiple functions to access private member data
	and polymorphism because every class created used either the PoweredVehicle parent class or the Vehicle parent class
